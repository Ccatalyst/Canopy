# Canopy

An application to create chat rooms for GitHub repo branches. Keep contributors up to date on the current goals, successes and blockers.

## Goal

To design a front end for an application that will use the github API to access a repository, list the branches of the repo for selection, and create chat rooms for each of the selected branches.

Technologies that will need to be implemented:

- OAuth2
- Github API
- socket.io or other chatroom technology
